Abstract of the paper
Recently, carbon-fiber composite material has been used extensively in aircraft structures. However, conventional carbon-fiber composite materials that are arranged with fibers in a straight line are problematic in that they tend to break with stress concentration. In a previous study, curvilinear fibers were used to achieve a high strength and a curvilinear fiber arrangement (optimum fiber arrangement) with the highest strength obtained by using a genetic algorithm (GA). GAs required extensive time to reach an optimal solution. Therefore, in this research, we proposed a new method that combines GAs and deep learning, and showed that the proposed method can shorten the calculation time compared with a conventional GA. The optimum fiber arrangement by the proposed method had a higher strength than the optimum fiber arrangement by the conventional GA in the specific optimization problem.
